# fs-exercice

You are required to code a chat application between a user and an agent.
A front-end application sends user messages to a back-end server, which replies back with the
agent's answer.

<br/>

#### Required:
- Separate the chat system into two sibling folders: “front” and “back”, where both
applications can be run independently. 
- The back-end server implements a RESTful service, exchanging JSON data with GET or
POST methods. 
- Each user message is sent to the back-end with the entire chat history. On the other
hand, the server replies with the agent’s reply only, without including the entire chat
history. 
- A chat history is required to be a series of alternate "user" and "agent" messages. If that
is not the case - for example, two consecutive "user" messages - the history should be
considered invalid. 
- If the server receives an invalid chat history, it should reply with a 400 Bad Request.

#### Not required:
- The agent’s replies can be static content, meaning some fixed content. There's no need
to simulate a real agent.
- The text can appear on the front page in block, without streaming word by word.
- Chat persistence.
- User management (multi-user management, user authentication, etc.)
